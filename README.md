<h3>Learning how to make forms submit info to email (without knowing php) </h3>

This was much easier than I anticipated. The documents uploaded here are a little ambiguous.
The HTML is from another project I am working on, and you'll notice the form styles aren't quite right (understatement, haha). I did not style the form, only tested for functionality using the mentioned project and platform it is hosted on. I then pushed the documents back here for my own reference in the future.
